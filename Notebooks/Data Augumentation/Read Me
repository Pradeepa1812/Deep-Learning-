->Data Augumentation helps you to create new images incase if you have very less number of images for training by 
using this to get more number of similar images

->I'm using Google Colab to implement these  Data Augumentation Project using Keras 
->Then I'll import all those necessary libraries in keras
->ImageDataGenerator class is very useful in image classification
->Batch_size=Number of samples proceed before the model is updated
